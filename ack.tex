I would like to express my sincere gratitude
to my advisor, Prof. Diomidis Spinellis,
and to my supervisor, Stauros Triantafyllos,
for their continuous support and guidance
during my internship,
and throughout the implementation
of the particular thesis.
Their formidable knowledge, advice, and motivation
have contributed not only to the fulfilment
of my objectives in the context of my internship,
but also to the wider advancement of my skills and personality.
