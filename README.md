# Implementation of Lexicon-based Sentiment Analysis on Greek Text Data

The particular thesis is being implemented in the context of my undergraduate studies at the [Athens University of Economics and Business](https://www.aueb.gr/en), in the [Department of Management Science and Technology](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/dmst), during the spring semester of 2019.

The thesis is a combination of:
1. the final report of my internship at [isMOOD Data Technology Services](https://www.ismood.com/) company, and
2. research associated with the project I have been working on during this internship

**isMOOD** is a Greek B2B company in the field of *Text Analytics*, providing services through an in-house platform and custom-made reports. The asset of isMOOD lies in the application of **sentiment analysis** on text data of various social media sources (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, news sites, forums, blogs, etc.).

My internship at isMOOD as a *Back-end Developer* involves the implementation of a *lexicon-based approach for sentiment analysis on Greek short text data*. The technologies I have been mostly using so far include **Python** and **MongoDB**.

My interest in the field of Sentiment Analysis has motivated me to associate the topic of my thesis with the above project, and further study methods for performing sentiment analysis on text data. My research is not language-restricted, nor limited to lexicon-based approaches; it also incorporates machine-learning methods and multi-lingual text data.
