# Implementation of Lexicon-based Sentiment Analysis on Greek Text Data

The particular thesis was implemented in the context of my undergraduate studies at the [Athens University of Economics and Business](https://www.aueb.gr/en), in the [Department of Management Science and Technology](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/dmst), during the spring semester of 2019.

The thesis is a combination of:
1. the final report of my internship at [isMOOD Data Technology Services](https://www.ismood.com/) company, and
2. research associated with the project I worked on during this internship

**isMOOD** is a Greek B2B company in the field of *Text Analytics*, providing services through an in-house platform and customised reports. The asset of isMOOD lies in the application of **sentiment analysis** on text data of various social media sources (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, news sites, forums, blogs, etc.).

My internship at isMOOD as a *Back-end Developer* involved the implementation of a *lexicon-based approach for sentiment analysis on Greek text data*. The technologies I used were **Python** and **MongoDB**.

My interest in the field of Sentiment Analysis motivated me to associate the topic of my thesis with the above project, and further study methods for performing sentiment analysis. My research focuses on lexicon-based approaches for multilingual and Greek text data.
